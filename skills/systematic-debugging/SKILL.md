# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

**Core principle:** Investigate before repairing. Use the cheapest observation that
distinguishes plausible causes, then fix the supported owning cause. Temporary
containment can be appropriate for corruption or dangerous side effects; label it
as containment and continue diagnosis.

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue:
- Test failures
- Bugs in production
- Unexpected behavior
- Performance problems
- Build failures
- Integration issues

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

**Don't skip when:**
- Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)
- You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)
- Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing)

## The Four Phases

Use these phases as an evidence loop. New observations can send the investigation
back to an earlier phase; keep the process proportional to the unresolved question.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Don't skip past errors or warnings
   - They often contain the exact solution
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?
   - Does it happen every time?
   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed that could cause this?
   - Git diff, recent commits
   - New dependencies, config changes
   - Environmental differences

4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**

   **WHEN system has multiple components (CI → build → signing, API → service → database):**

   **Inspect retained evidence first; add instrumentation only where it cannot distinguish the plausible causes:**
   ```
   For the implicated component boundaries:
     - Log what data enters component
     - Log what data exits component
     - Verify environment/config propagation
     - Check state at each layer

   Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
   THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component
   THEN investigate that specific component
   ```

   **Example (multi-layer system):**
   ```bash
   # Layer 1: Workflow
   echo "=== Secrets available in workflow: ==="
   echo "IDENTITY: $([ -n "${IDENTITY:-}" ] && echo SET || echo UNSET)"

   # Layer 2: Build script
   echo "=== Env vars in build script: ==="
   printenv IDENTITY >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "IDENTITY in environment" || echo "IDENTITY not in environment"

   # Layer 3: Signing script
   echo "=== Keychain state: ==="
   security list-keychains
   security find-identity -v

   # Layer 4: Actual signing
   codesign --sign "$IDENTITY" --verbose=4 "$APP"
   ```

   **This reveals:** Which layer fails (secrets → workflow ✓, workflow → build ✗)

5. **Trace Data Flow**

   **WHEN error is deep in call stack:**

   See `root-cause-tracing.md` in this directory for the complete backward tracing technique.

   **Quick version:**
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

### Optional runtime and agent-boundary observations

Choose tools for a named question: native LLDB MCP or CodeLLDB for native/Rust
stacks and values, debugpy for Python state, strace for process/wait/pipe/system-call
behavior, or rr for compatible record/replay. Check actual availability; retain
original logs and exact reproduction identity. Pausing, tracing, or recording may
change deadlines and scheduling; diagnostic runs do not replace normally timed
runtime or qualification evidence.

When evidence crosses an agent/tool boundary, use
[agent-boundary-evidence.md](references/agent-boundary-evidence.md) for focused
input/output and identity tracing. Preserve existing project evidence owners.

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Find the pattern before fixing:**

1. **Find Working Examples**
   - Locate similar working code in same codebase
   - What works that's similar to what's broken?

2. **Compare Against References**
   - Read enough of the current, version-matched reference to resolve the
     specific uncertainty; understand relevant assumptions before applying it.

3. **Identify Differences**
   - What's different between working and broken?
   - List every difference, however small
   - Don't assume "that can't matter"

4. **Understand Dependencies**
   - What other components does this need?
   - What settings, config, environment?
   - What assumptions does it make?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

**Scientific method:**

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**
   - State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
   - Write it down
   - Be specific, not vague

2. **Test Minimally**
   - Prefer the smallest observation or disposable experiment that tests the hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify Before Continuing**
   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4
   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
   - DON'T add more fixes on top

4. **When You Don't Know**
   - Say "I don't understand X"
   - Don't pretend to know
   - Ask for help
   - Research more

### Phase 4: Implementation

**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**

1. **Create Failing Test Case**
   - Simplest possible reproduction
   - Automated test if possible
   - One-off test script if no framework
   - Use the smallest authoritative proof layer; preserve missing evidence explicitly
   - Use the `superpowers:test-driven-development` skill for writing proper failing tests

2. **Implement Single Fix**
   - Address the root cause identified
   - ONE change at a time
   - No "while I'm here" improvements
   - No bundled refactoring

3. **Verify Fix**
   - Test passes now?
   - No other tests broken?
   - Issue actually resolved?
   - Use the `superpowers:verification-before-completion` skill before claiming success

4. **If Fix Doesn't Work**
   - Classify the result as supported, contradicted, or inconclusive.
   - Stop stacking speculative edits; update the hypothesis from new evidence.
   - Three equivalent failed fixes without meaningful new evidence are a default
     checkpoint for [bounded research](references/repeated-failure-research.md).
     Escalate sooner when repetition is obvious; new evidence can justify more
     experiments within task scope and budget.
   - Architecture conclusions require structural evidence such as conflicting
     owners, unavoidable coupling, or authority violations. Attempt count alone
     does not establish an architecture defect.

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "Pattern says X but I'll adapt it differently"
- "Here are the main problems: [lists fixes without investigation]"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- **Repeating an equivalent fix without new evidence**
- **Each fix reveals new problem in different place**

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

**If equivalent fixes repeat without new evidence:** use the bounded research checkpoint.

## your human partner's Signals You're Doing It Wrong

**Watch for these redirections:**
- "Is that not happening?" - You assumed without verifying
- "Will it show us...?" - You should have added evidence gathering
- "Stop guessing" - You're proposing fixes without understanding
- "Ultra-think this" - Question fundamentals, not just symptoms
- "We're stuck?" (frustrated) - Your approach isn't working

**When you see these:** STOP. Return to Phase 1.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "I'll write test after confirming fix works" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "Reference too long, I'll guess" | Read the relevant owner and assumptions; retain unresolved questions explicitly. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more equivalent fix without new evidence" | Pause speculative edits and run bounded research; attempt count is not architecture proof. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |

## When Process Reveals "No Root Cause"

If systematic investigation reveals issue is truly environmental, timing-dependent, or external:

1. You've completed the process
2. Document what you investigated
3. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message)
4. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation

Missing evidence is an investigation limit, not proof that the environment or
architecture is at fault. Report what was observed and what remains unknown.

## Supporting Techniques

These techniques are part of systematic debugging and available in this directory:

- **`root-cause-tracing.md`** - Trace bugs backward through call stack to find original trigger
- **`defense-in-depth.md`** - Add validation at multiple layers after finding root cause
- **`condition-based-waiting.md`** - Replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling

## Fixtures and readiness

Use bounded fixtures that retain the behavior relevant to the failure: real
parser/queue/file or process semantics where those own truth, controlled inputs
at irrelevant external boundaries. Do not copy an entire dependency or repository
structure solely to make a mock look realistic. Record what the fixture omits;
it cannot replace required native/runtime proof.

Wait for operation-specific readiness (an acknowledged state, process result,
file receipt, or matching event) with a bounded deadline and fresh observations.
Prefer event-aware waits when available; polling needs a bounded interval and
clear timeout/cancellation. Arbitrary sleeps are not evidence of readiness.
